# UGV_sensor_fault_detection rawdata

The "Normal_rawdata" folder contains unprocessed data in a fault-free state. 
data1 and data2 represent circular trajectories in counterclockwise (CCW) and clockwise (CW) directions, respectively. 
data3 and data4 represent clover trajectories in CCW and CW directions, respectively, and data5 represents an infinity-shaped trajectory. 

The faulty data used for training was generated by injecting faults into the raw data.

# UGV_sensor_fault_detection experimental video
The "sensor_fault_detection_video.mp4" exhibits the results of applying the proposed fault detection and toleration technique, displaying normal, faulty, and the implemented fault detection and toleration outcomes from the paper.
